Call for papers: Privacy in Machine Learning (PriML) 2021
Virtual workshop: Tuesday, December 14, 2021
Website: https://priml2021.github.io/

# Description

This one-day workshop focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis, both in the distributed and centralized settings, and on scenarios that highlight the importance and need for these techniques (e.g., via privacy attacks). There is growing interest from the Machine Learning (ML) community in leveraging cryptographic techniques such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for secure computation during training and inference, as well as Differential Privacy (DP) for limiting the privacy risks from the trained model itself. We encourage both theory and application-oriented submissions exploring a range of approaches listed below. 

Privacy-preserving machine learning
Differential privacy: theory, applications, and implementations
Statistical and information-theoretic notions of privacy, including DP relaxations
Empirical and theoretical comparisons between different notions of privacy
Privacy-preserving data sharing, anonymization, and privacy of synthetic data
Privacy attacks
Federated and decentralized privacy-preserving algorithms
Policy-making aspects of data privacy
Secure multi-party computation techniques for machine learning
Learning on encrypted data, homomorphic encryption
Privacy in autonomous systems
Online social networks privacy
Privacy and private learning in computer vision and natural language processing tasks
Programming languages for privacy-preserving data analysis
Relations of privacy with fairness, transparency, and adversarial robustness
Machine unlearning and data-deletion

# Submission instructions

Submissions in the form of extended abstracts must be at most 4 pages long (not including references; additional supplementary material may be submitted but may be ignored by reviewers), non-anonymized, and adhere to the NeurIPS format. We encourage the submission of work that is new to the privacy-preserving machine learning community. Submissions solely based on work that has been previously published in conferences on machine learning and related fields are not suitable for the workshop. On the other hand, we allow submission of works currently under submission and relevant works recently previously published in privacy and security venues. Submission of work under review at NeurIPS 2021 is allowed but this must be disclosed at submission time. Submissions accepted to the NeurIPS main conference may be deprioritized in selecting oral presentations. The workshop will not have formal proceedings, but authors of accepted abstracts can choose to have a link to arxiv or a pdf added on the workshop webpage.
